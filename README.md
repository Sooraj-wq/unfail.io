# Unfail.io üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: SyntaxError


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sooraj V - College of Engineering Trivandrum

### Project Description
Unfail.io is your sarcastically motivating life assistant that ‚Äúunfails‚Äù your failures with witty prompts, motivational advice, and a dash of humor. Tell it what went sideways, and it‚Äôll try (maybe) to help you get back on track ‚Äî or at least make you smile.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Nobody asked for another motivational app that sugarcoats failure. I am here to solve the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù of being *too* serious about setbacks with sarcastic quotes, unhelpful tips, and uselessly useful advice.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We deliver a snarky, half-helpful companion that mocks your mistakes and serves inspiration with a side of sarcasm. Because life‚Äôs too short to take yourself seriously all the time.
