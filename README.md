# Unfail.io üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: SyntaxError


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sooraj V - College of Engineering Trivandrum

### Project Description
Unfail.io is your sarcastically motivating life assistant that ‚Äúunfails‚Äù your failures with witty prompts, motivational advice, and a dash of humor. Tell it what went sideways, and it‚Äôll try (maybe) to help you get back on track ‚Äî or at least make you smile.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Nobody asked for another motivational app that sugarcoats failure. I am here to solve the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù of being *too* serious about setbacks with sarcastic quotes, unhelpful tips, and uselessly useful advice.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We deliver a snarky, half-helpful companion that mocks your mistakes and serves inspiration with a side of sarcasm. Because life‚Äôs too short to take yourself seriously all the time.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Next.js, React, Tailwind, Node.js
- Lucide-react icons for UI
- Fetch API for communication

### Implementation
For Software:

The project is built using **Next.js** with React for the frontend, providing a fast, server-side rendered experience. Tailwind CSS powers the stylish and responsive UI, making the sarcastic vibe visually appealing and easy to navigate.

- The splash screen is shown initially with a fade-out animation before revealing the main interface.
- Once the splash fades, a random sarcastic quote is displayed alongside an input field where users can describe what went wrong.
- On submission, the input is sent to a backend API route (`/api/get-solution`), which processes the request (mock or real logic) and returns a motivational quote, suggested solutions, related news articles, YouTube video guides, and personality stories.
- The frontend then animates the display of the response with sections styled using a custom sketchy border effect.
- Additional UI features include smooth transitions, loading states, and error handling to maintain a polished user experience.
- Iconography is handled by the Lucide-react library to complement the sarcastic, playful tone.
